# I am PixEthos!

My username "PIX" is my coding philosophy

My coding philosophy is as follows:
- Personally implement everything
- Implement with KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
- Test everything, religiously (or "X" as a stand-in for 10)

Can be simplified to "PIT" – anyway, this is just what my coding philosophy is, not trademark or anything behind it. Just a random thing I made up, after the failed development of my previous AI algorithm.

I currently prioritize developing in Golang, as it's a simple language; it even has a pretty solid development experience. Reminds me a lot with C – as a result – I have a lot of fun coding in it! Straight forward simplicity, readable, and digestible; even fitting into my philosophy. So, I use it.
