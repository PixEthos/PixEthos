# I am PixEthos!

I currently prioritize developing in Golang, as it's a simple language; it even has a pretty solid development experience. Reminds me a lot with C – as a result – I have a lot of fun coding in it! Straight forward simplicity, readable, and digestible; even fitting into my philosophy. So, I use it. 

It's pretty ironic buddy, a couple of dogs like us using a literal website designed by a broker. The VS Code software too, what a joke, right? But you know something, buddy? I don't scrape data for money; that's just doxxing with extra steps – and I personally hate that in every capacity.
